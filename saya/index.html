A year later I was all but building the company’s product for the smartphone market. Saya is different from most of the messaging applications currently attracting the eyes of the press. Their expertise is in low-end devices, enabling advanced functionality such as Facebook chat, group discussions, location-based chat, and exchange of multi-media.</p><section class="center"><img class="figure-normal" src="/images/saya-feature-phone_2x.47a2f3fdd99ae.jpg" alt="Saya Feature Phone Screenshot"></section><p>With low-end device users switching to smartphones, Saya needed to be reimagined for a cross platform world.</p><p>Cross platform design is hard, and initial attempts Saya made in the market were not received with the joy they were seeing in the low-end devices so I was asked to help. Consumers want features that take advantage of the device, but maintain simplicity and purpose. The best experiences build for each operating system by recycling patterns to keep the cognitive load low. So core features were adapted while maintaining backwards compatibility and new features were developed to take advantage of the power in a smartphone.</p><p>Saya is busy building their new smartphone platform so there is little I can elaborate on beyond what you’ll see below.</p><p>No feature was designed in a vacuum. While things may have a familiar look, they deliver much more value to the user than their usual counterparts. The design is beyond visual, diving deep into usability and extension of common objects.</p></section><section class="center"><img class="figure-full" src="/images/saya-wireframe-01_2x.5738bc8acc722.png" alt="Saya Messages"></section><section class="guides-local fade"><p>They are your friends, but how hard is it to keep up with all the updates in their lives?

This required all the visual elements of the OS to be created from scratch and componentized so they could be easily updated with each new beta release. Tab bar icons were designed to be simple and refined; created from scratch for features old and new.</p><div class="center"><img class="figure-full" src="/images/saya-tab-bar_2x.f4be7bca976bd.png" alt="Saya Tab Bar Icons"></div><p>Warm colors of the sun influenced the pink, orange and yellow chosen to represent the next generation of the platform. These colors and the new iconography will eventually be incorporated into the low-end devices.</p></section><section class="center"><div class="frame-iphone frame-iphone_proportional"><div class="frame-iphone-border frame_proportional-border"><img class="frame-iphone-content" width="320" src="/images/saya-iphone_2x.282a83027dd6b.png" alt="Saya iPhone Screenshot"></div></div><div class="frame-android frame-android_proportional"><div class="frame-android-border frame_proportional-border"><img class="frame-android-content" width="360" src="/images/saya-android_2x.e6f95ee10b28b.png" alt="Saya Android Screenshot"></div></div></section><section class="guides-local"><p>Finally. It was time to say goodbye to drop shadows, strong gradients, strokes and the colors green and blue. The new logo draws inspiration from symbols old and new. The hash, popularized by Twitter and symbolizing communication of today. And the exclamation mark from Saya’s previous logo, popularized by Yahoo! Mail and symbolizing the communication of yesterday.</p><ul class="group"><li class="group-item"><img class="group-item-image" src="/images/saya-mark-before.712e323cc6ab4.png" alt="Saya App Icon"></li><li class="group-item"><img class="group-item-image" src="/images/saya-mark-after.92da3ccc0f8b7.png" alt="Saya App Icon"></li></ul><p>The new identity was designed from the start to live in an app world, the square. The design evolved with the wireframes and other iconography, taking more than a weekend. Saya is positioned to capture the next billion users as they move messaging from low-end devices to smartphones by never losing a friend in the process.</p><div class="center"><img class="figure-small" src="/images/saya-app-icon_2x.a54f65501d3a4.png" alt="Saya App Icon"></div></section><footer><div class="separator"></div><p>Saya is a trademark of Saya Mobile, Ltd.</p></footer></div><script src="/scripts/script.538cff0555e44.js"></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
