It comes down to trying to expose yourself, to the best things that humans have done. And then try to bring those things in to what you&#8217;re doing.</p><cite><a href="https://www.pbs.org/nerds/transcript.html" target="_blank">Steven P. Jobs</a></cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>Good artists copy. Great artists steal.</p><cite>Pablo Picasso</cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>For every new feature we add, we take an old one out.

A logo derives its meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around. A logo is less important than the product it signifies; what it means is more important than what it looks like.</p><cite>Paul Rand</cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>...most of the mediocre design today comes from designers who are faithfully doing as they were taught in school: they worship at the altar of the visual.</p><cite><a href="http://risd.generic.cx/why.html" target="_blank">Michael Bierut</a></cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>It&#8217;s not just what it looks like and feels like.
