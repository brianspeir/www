The skincare industry is overrun with new products promising miracles of this and that. The design has to be as honest as the product and “not attempt to manipulate the customer with promises that cannot be kept.”</p><p>Iconography feels ill fit given this guiding principle. And the current brand-scape has as many typefaces as it has infomercials. So the hopes of starting with a commercial typeface would result in a logo neither distinct or memorable enough to do its job.</p><p>The signature reinforces the founders name already behind the company. It also has the advantage of avoiding the lab, infomercial or overly brandy look that often complicates one’s ability to build trust.</p><div class="center"><img class="figure-full" alt="Pieces of a Signature" src="/images/arjarun-inspiration_2x.7adc066f38dbf.png"></div><p>But personal signatures often present visibility and adaptability issues. So a custom script was designed from handwriting samples to ensure visibility and adaptability and all but guarantees to be distinct and memorable.</p><p>The signature is set lowercase, turning the signature into a ribbon that can be wrapped around bottles, tubes, boxes, bags, etc. This decision also allows the “a” to repeat and reinforce spelling.</p></section></div><div class="content-arjarun-mark-color"></div><div class="guides-master"><section class="guides-local fade"><p>Five colors are used to represent the different product lines by skin types.</p><ul class="group"><li class="group-item"><img class="group-item-image" src="/images/arjarun-swatch-01.fab7749f95afa.svg" alt="Arjarun Swatch Color"></li><li class="group-item"><img class="group-item-image" src="/images/arjarun-swatch-02.1cc723bb4c42e.svg" alt="Arjarun Swatch Color"></li><li class="group-item"><img class="group-item-image" src="/images/arjarun-swatch-03.245c50011dd65.svg" alt="Arjarun Swatch Color"></li><li class="group-item"><img class="group-item-image" src="/images/arjarun-swatch-04.c2cec4c50ed02.svg" alt="Arjarun Swatch Color"></li><li class="group-item"><img class="group-item-image" src="/images/arjarun-swatch-05.905e2fe559734.svg" alt="Arjarun Swatch Color"></li></ul><p>The final identity is presented below on stationary designed for the company.
