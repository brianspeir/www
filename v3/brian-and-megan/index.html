Good proof that guests will communicate in any fashion they damn well please. . We knew who would use the site and who wouldn’t. Although is was a lot of fun to run analytics on those guests that did visit the site. Still proof that design should fit the task. It’s not often that I get to build a skeuomorphic site.</p></section><div class="center"><div class="frame-browser"><div class="frame-browser-border fade"><iframe class="frame-browser-content fade-longer" height="768" seamless width="1024" src="http://www.brianandmegan.org"></iframe></div></div></div></div><script src="/scripts/script.538cff0555e44.js"></script></body></html>
