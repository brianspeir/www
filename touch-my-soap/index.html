High fashion soap is a crowded market. An identity was needed that could stand up against provocative photography in the marketing, yet be memorable and family friendly when applied to the product on the shelf.</p><p>Sometimes you work forever and just draw a blank.

In the end emerged a pure and simple logo that worked on bags, boxes, paper, stamps, engravings, molds, etc. The duck is a pattern that can be applied to anything in any color or size desired.</p><div class="center"><img class="figure-normal" src="/images/touch-my-soap-bag.26ebfba0e1335.svg" alt="Touch My Soap Bag"></div></section><footer><div class="separator"></div><p>Touch My Soap and the Duck logo are trademarks of Touch My Soap, Inc.</p></footer></div><script src="/scripts/script.538cff0555e44.js"></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
