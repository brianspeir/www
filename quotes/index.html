It comes down to trying to expose yourself, to the best things that humans have done. And then try to bring those things in to what you&#8217;re doing.</p><cite><a href="https://www.pbs.org/nerds/transcript.html">Steven P. Jobs</a></cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>Good artists copy. Great artists steal.</p><cite>Pablo Picasso</cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>For every new feature we add, we take an old one out. A lot of big sites don&#8217;t do that, and it&#8217;s a problem. Twitter started as a beautifully simple product, but it&#8217;s now going the same route as Facebook. The drive to innovate can overencumber and destroy a product.</p><cite><a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/201106/the-way-i-work-david-karp-of-tumblr.html">David Karp</a></cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>Good design is as little design as possible. Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.<br><br>Back to purity, back to simplicity.</p><cite>Dieter Rams</cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>The roots of good design lie in aesthetics: painting, drawing, and architecture, while those of business and market research are in demographics and statistics; aesthetics and business are traditionally incompatible disciplines.</p><cite>Paul Rand</cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>A logo doesn’t sell, it identifies. A logo derives its meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around. A logo is less important than the product it signifies; what it means is more important than what it looks like.</p><cite>Paul Rand</cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>...most of the mediocre design today comes from designers who are faithfully doing as they were taught in school: they worship at the altar of the visual.</p><cite><a href="http://risd.generic.cx/why.html">Michael Bierut</a></cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>It&#8217;s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</p><cite><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/magazine/30IPOD.html">Steve Jobs</a></cite></blockquote><blockquote class="quote"><p>But then you meet the girl, and she says, &#8220;Let me see what&#8217;s on your iPod.&#8221; You pull out a tape player, and she walks away.</p><cite><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/magazine/30IPOD.html">Steve Jobs</a></cite></blockquote></section></div><script src="/scripts/script.538cff0555e44.js"></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
